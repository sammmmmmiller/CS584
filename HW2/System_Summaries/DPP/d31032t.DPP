President Boris Yeltsin has suffered minor burns on his right hand, his press office said Thursday. Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on Monday due to a respiratory infection that revived questions about his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained economic crisis. Yeltsin insists he has no major illness and plans to serve out the remaining two years of his term. Doctors ordered the president to stay in bed Tuesday and his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, had said Yeltsin would not be in the office all week. Russia's Constitutional Court opened hearings Thursday on whether Boris Yeltsin can seek a third term.
