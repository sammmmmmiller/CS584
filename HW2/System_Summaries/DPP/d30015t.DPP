U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke said Monday the military situation in Kosovo was as bad now as two weeks ago. We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation, he said. The Russians are against using NATO force in Kosovo. Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have routed separatist Kosovo Albanian rebels in the crackdown that began in late February. The American envoy Richard Holbrooke met with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia Monday night and according to American diplomats told him that he had to take further steps to pull back his military in Kosovo Province or face a NATO attack.
