Famine-threatened North Korea's harvest will be no better this year than last and could be worse, a senior U.N. aid official said Saturday. Years of food shortages have stunted the growth of millions of North Korean children, with two-thirds of children under age seven suffering malnourishment, U.N. experts said Wednesday. Hunger and malnutrition in Cambodia are reaching crisis levels comparable to the effects of famine in North Korea, a U.N. World Food Program representative said Tuesday. The problem is so bad that it is only a little worse in North Korea, Davies said. He said they had crossed into China seeking food, not because of political repression in North Korea.
