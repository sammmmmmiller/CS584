Microsoft asserts that Windows and Internet Explorer are a single product and that Microsoft alone defines what is in the product. The company also agreed to stop tying the sale of one software product to the sale of another. In a letter to the Justice Department, Netscape said that Microsoft was using its dominance in personal-computer operating systems to force or persuade computer makers to favor Microsoft's browser, used to explore the World Wide Web, over the one marketed by Netscape. In the June ruling, a federal appeals court said that Microsoft could bundle its browser with its industry-standard Windows operating system and call them one product.
