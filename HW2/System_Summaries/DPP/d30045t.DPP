The reported talks between Exxon, whose annual revenue exceeds that of Wal-Mart and General Electric, and Mobil, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, come as oil prices have sunk to their lowest in almost 12 years. Both companies are under pressure to find new fields of oil to help them survive in the long term. Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. have held discussions about combining their business operations, a person involved in the talks said Wednesday. Some analysts said that if the two giants reached an agreement, it was likely to be in the form of a takeover by Exxon of Mobil. Which is why Mobil and Exxon are considering combining into the world's largest oil company.
