Chechen police were searching Wednesday for the bodies of four kidnapped foreigners who were beheaded during a botched attempt to free them. Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said Wednesday that one alleged kidnapper had been arrested and authorities gleaned enough information to launch a rescue operation for the hostages, three Britons and a New Zealander. Assailants have abducted Chechnya's top prosecutor, who was investigating the killings of four kidnapped foreigners, officials said Friday. It was unclear where Cochetel was held, in the breakaway republic of Chechnya or in North Ossetia. They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny.
