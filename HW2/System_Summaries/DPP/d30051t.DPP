The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Monday acquitted a Muslim military commander of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992, but convicted three underlings in the first U.N. case dealing with anti-Serb atrocities. The tribunal convicted camp warden Zdravko Mucic, a Croat, of 11 war crimes and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions because he oversaw guards who murdered nine Serbs and tortured six. Delic was cleared of two murders, and of command responsibility for other killings at Celebici. To his Muslim targets, Bosnian Serb Goran Jelisic was the face of genocide who once bragged that he had to kill 20 or 30 Muslims before his morning coffee.
