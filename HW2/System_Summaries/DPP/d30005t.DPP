Saqib said his inquiry will wind up on Nov. 20 and if there is no evidence against bin Laden the at least for the Taliban. The United States has obtained new evidence to link the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in a U.S. cruise missile strike last month to a terrorist group backed by Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East Africa, according to U.S. intelligence officials. It is not clear from the materials whether the report in the computer was forwarded to bin Laden. They have cited the source in the papers filed to support the extradition of two associates of bin Laden who are under arrest in Germany and Britain.
