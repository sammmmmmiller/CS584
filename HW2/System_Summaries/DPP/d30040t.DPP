It was not clear who would be the first arrivals at the airport. Taking a major step toward statehood, the Palestinians on Tuesday inaugurated Gaza International Airport, their first gateway to the world, with cheers, tears and an outpouring of patriotism. Disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over security had delayed the airport opening for more than two years. Palestinians living in the West Bank still need a permit to cross Israel into Gaza to get to the airport. Israeli security officials delayed two planes from taking off from the Palestinian airport on Wednesday, the latest tensions in a rare area of Israeli-Palestinian cooperation.
