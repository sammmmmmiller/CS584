Premier-designate Bulent Ecevit said Thursday he would persist in the difficult task of convincing a key party leader to join forces in a secular coalition. Ecevit tried in vain to form a coalition government with two rival center-right wing parties one led by Yilmaz, the other by former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. It is now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win a vote of confidence, former Premier Mesut Yilmaz said after talks with Demirel. Ecevit refused even to consult with the leader of the Virtue Party during his efforts to form a government. The Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, however, withheld immediate support for Yalim Erez.
