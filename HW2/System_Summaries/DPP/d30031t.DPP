The shuttle contains the second station component. It was the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched. It was crucial that Zarya and Unity be joined; if they could not be connected with the robot arm, NASA would have sent out two spacewalking astronauts to manually fit them together. Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay. A last-minute alarm forced NASA to halt Thursday's launching of the space shuttle Endeavour, on a mission to start assembling the international space station.
