China released a respected, but ailing labor rights campaigner from a prison work camp Sunday and immediately sent him into exile in the United States. Chinese courts sentenced dissidents Xu Wenli and Wang Youcai to 13 and 11 years for trying to organize an opposition political party. He has told police interrogators he expects to be jailed, likely for a few years less than the 13 given China Democracy Party leader Xu Wenli on Monday. Also sentenced Monday, to 11 years in prison, was Wang Youcai, 32, founder of the China Democracy Party, which has now been suppressed. Relatives of Qin in China denied the reports, however, and said that his trial continued.
