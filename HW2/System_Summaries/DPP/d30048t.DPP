Brazil and the International Monetary Fund moved closer Tuesday to agreement on an expected dlrs 30 billion rescue package for the world's ninth-largest economy. Brazil is the latest country to be hit by the financial crisis that began 15 months ago in Asia and then spread to Russia. There's no such thing as a free lunch any longer in Brazil, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is telling government workers. But as Cardoso readies a package of spending cuts and tax increases, he clearly wants to show Brazilians that economy starts at home. With 160 million people, Brazil represents the world's ninth-largest economy and is the financial engine of Latin America.
