Pinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday by British police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge. Pinochet, commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until March, has immunity from prosecution in Chile as a senator-for-life under a new constitution that his government crafted. Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16 at the instigation of Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzon who is seeking to extradite the former dictator on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture. Europe's top official said Friday that he hoped former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet would be extradited to Spain to be tried for crimes committed during his 17-year rule.
