IOC described as humanitarian aid by Salt Lake officials _ amounted to a bribe. Marc Hodler, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee executive board, alleged malpractices in the bid campaigns for the games of 1996, 1998, 2000 and 2002. Hodler said a group of four agents, including one IOC member, have been involved in promising votes for payment. Hodler's allegations, made to a group of reporters, came as the IOC continued investigations into alleged financial misconduct by the Salt Lake City group which won the bid for the 2002 games. Hodler, who made the allegations Saturday, said he has since been muzzled by IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
