Congolese rebels have taken their two-month campaign to oust President Laurent Kabila to the Internet. After a day of fighting, Congolese rebels said Sunday they had entered Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by the government to halt their advances. On Sunday, a spokesman in Goma boasted that Kindu was already under rebel control. The rebels have targeted Kindu since late August, when they were forced to retreat from the outskirts of Kinshasa after Angola and Zimbabwe sent troops to bail out Kabila. On Saturday, the rebels shot down a Congolese Boeing 727 over the Kindu airport. Rebels said the airplane was carrying 40 troops and ammunition.
