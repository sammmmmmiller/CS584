After first suggesting that the former deputy prime minister had beaten himself on the face, neck and arms during 10 days in police custody, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called for an investigation of the wounds Anwar displayed in court Tuesday and Wednesday. Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, saying he was morally unfit for office. The two had differed over economic policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was a threat to his 17-year rule. Anwar since has been charged with corruption and illegal homosexual acts, and is to go on trial Nov. 2. A general election is not scheduled until 2000.
