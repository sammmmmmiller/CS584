All the 118 legislators present at the session cast votes in his favor. Parliament on Thursday formally elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president. Lahoud is to be sworn in for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaves office. A presidential decree was expected Friday but nothing came through after a meeting between Lahoud and Hariri. There has been no formal announcement from Lahoud reappointing Hariri as prime minister. In a statement, Lahoud said Hariri was asked but declined to form the next government after a previous round of consultations.
