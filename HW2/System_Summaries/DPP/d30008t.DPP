Asia-Pacific leaders are scheduled to meet next month in Malaysia for an annual economics meeting. Last week, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he was considering not going to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum because of Anwar Ibrahim's arrest. The leaders of Malaysia's ruling party met Tuesday to discuss a replacement for ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, who faces trial next month in a case that will test the country's legal system. He said, however, that his support is personal and moral and not meant to interfere in the internal problems of Malaysia. So far, APEC has been criticized for doing little during the financial crisis.
