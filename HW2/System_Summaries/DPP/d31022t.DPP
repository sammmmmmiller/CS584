Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when the blaze started with about 400 people inside. Fire officials were alerted at 11:43 p.m. Thursday and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue workers said. A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180. The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when 20 people died in the town of Boraas. Goteborg is today a city in shock. The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening.
