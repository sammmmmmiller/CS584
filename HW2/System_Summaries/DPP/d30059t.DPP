A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was killed Friday in St. Petersburg, a news report said. It gave no other details. Starovoitova tried to run for president in the 1996 elections but her registration was turned down for technical reasons. Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked the entry way of an apartment building, police said. There have been several attacks on prominent figures in St. Petersburg recently. Starovoitova was shot to death Friday evening as she and an aide scaled the stairs to her apartment in St. Petersburg.
