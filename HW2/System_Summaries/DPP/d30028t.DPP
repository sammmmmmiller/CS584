Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met here Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and Turkey. The talks in Damascus came as Turkey has massed forces near the border with Syria after threatening to eradicate Kurdish rebel bases in the neighboring country. Egypt already has launched a mediation effort to try to prevent a military confrontation over Turkish allegations that Syria is harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels. Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting fears of an attack. Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring Kurdish rebels and blamed Israel for the rising tension between Syria and Turkey.
