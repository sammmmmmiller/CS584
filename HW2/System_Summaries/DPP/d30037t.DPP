Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves as the bullet of mercy for the Middle East peace process, an official Syrian newspaper said Saturday. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians. Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. Ariel Sharon has a law degree, and fancies himself a farmer. The most optimistic reading is that Sharon, long an implacable foe of the Palestinians, is prepared to make peace with them and then sell it to the Israelis who are most opposed.
