A Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast faces an uncertain future following the detention in Rome of its founder and leader. Turkey stepped up the pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, warning Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to opening doors to terrorism. If Italy sends the Kurd leader back to Turkey, he'll be tortured for certain, said Dino Frisullo, an Italian supporter among the singing, chanting Kurds outside the military hospital. Ocalan faces the death penalty in Turkey, a fact that has heightened opposition in Italy to his extradition. Ocalan is currently being held in Rome.
