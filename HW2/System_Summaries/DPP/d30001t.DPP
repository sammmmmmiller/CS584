Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have charged that Hun Sen's victory in the elections was achieved through widespread fraud. Hun Sen said his current government would remain in power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one. Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse. After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly. Ranariddh told reporters Wednesday that he believed it was safe for Sam Rainsy in Cambodia.
