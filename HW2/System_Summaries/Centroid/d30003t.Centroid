British police arrested Pinochet in his bed Friday at a private London hospital in response to a request from Spain, which wants to question Pinochet about allegations of murder during the decade after he seized power in 1973.
As his lawyers in London tried to quash a Spanish arrest warrant for Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, efforts began in Geneva and Paris to have him extradited.
Pinochet was detained by British police in London on Oct. 16 by request of a Spanish magistrate as a first step toward his extradition to stand trial for genocide and terrorism.
The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain.
