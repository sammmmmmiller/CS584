Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on Monday due to a respiratory infection that revived questions about his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained economic crisis.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who is still recuperating from his latest illness, has canceled a trip to an Asian summit next month, his office said Friday.
The 67-year-old president, whose health has often sidelined him during his seven years in power, has spent most of the last two months out of the limelight and out of the Kremlin, holding meetings in his country home outside Moscow.
Primakov said afterward that Yeltsin waved his hand dismissively when we reminded him that he should stay in bed during his illness and said of his doctors : Don't listen to them.
