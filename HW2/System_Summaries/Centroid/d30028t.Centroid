The Turkish daily Milliyet speculated Sunday that Turkey could stage pinpoint attacks in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of eastern Lebanon, where Turkey says rebels of Abdullah Ocalan's Kurdish Workers Party, or PKK, maintain camps.
For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
As Turkey kept up warlike rhetoric against Damascus, Egypt on Sunday began shuttle democracy between the two neighbors to avoid a military confrontation over Turkish Kurdish bases in Syria.
Since the Syrian-Turkish crisis began, Israeli defense minister Yitzhak Mordechai has said Israel is not a party to it and that the Israeli-Turkish military coooperation is not directed against any third state.
