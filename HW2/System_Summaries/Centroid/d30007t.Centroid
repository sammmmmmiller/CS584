After trekking several hundred kilometers( miles) through dense tropical forest, thousands of rebel fighters have gathered 19 kilometers( 11 miles) outside Kindu, where troops loyal to President Laurent Kabila have used an air base as a launching pad for offensives.
After a day of fighting, Congolese rebels said Sunday they had entered Kindu, the strategic town and airbase in eastern Congo used by the government to halt their advances.
Rebel commanders said Tuesday they were poised to overrun an important government-held air base in eastern Congo a battle that could determine the future of the two-month Congolese war.
Fighting in Kindu, 32 kilometers( 20 miles) northeast of the Elila River bridge, died down after the rebels fired a barrage of artillery into the government-held quarters and the air base, four kilometers( two miles) away.
