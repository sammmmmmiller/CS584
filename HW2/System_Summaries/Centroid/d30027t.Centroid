IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to come up with a sound economic program before the installment is given, and have made it clear that currency controls and boosting the money supply by printing rubles are not acceptable.
Responding to media reports of a government economic plan that would prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars and other foreign currency, Primakov said the reports absolutely do not correspond to reality, ITAR-Tass quoted him as saying.
Russia wants the IMF to release the second dlrs 4.3 billion installment of a loan that was approved in July, a month before the country's economy crashed and the government effectively defaulted on its foreign loans.
Soon after, U.S. officials gathered in the White House situation room to consider what might happen to Russia if the ruble was devalued and market reforms collapsed and to push the IMF to come up with emergency money.
