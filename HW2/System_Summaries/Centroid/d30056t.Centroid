Tagirov was investigating the deaths of four foreigners whose severed heads were found Tuesday lined up by a roadside in the breakaway Russian republic.
The heads were identified as those of the four abducted foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to the four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny.
Since Chechnya's two-year war of independence against Russia ended in 1996, hundreds of people have been kidnapped in the breakaway republic and neighboring regions by armed gangs who are mostly motivated by ransom.
A French United Nations official kidnapped in southern Russia more than 10 months ago has been freed and was flown to Moscow Saturday, news reports reported.
His release came four days after the severed heads of four foreign hostages were found in Chechnya when a government rescue attempt apparently went wrong.
