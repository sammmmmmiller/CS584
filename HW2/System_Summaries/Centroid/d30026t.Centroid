America Online Inc. wants to become the next Microsoft in two promising information-age fields where Microsoft Corp. is just another company the Internet media business and electronic commerce.
In a telephone interview from America Online's headquarters in Dulles, Va., Case described Netscape as an enterprise that had morphed itself from a company dependent on sales of its software used to browse the World Wide Web and in Microsoft's cross-hairs into a business that relied on advertising and other revenues from its popular Netcenter Web site and from selling software to corporations to handle electronic commerce.
Michael Lacovara, a Microsoft lawyer who was questioning a government witness, economist Frederick Warren-Boulton, suggested to him during the trial Monday that the proposed acquisition undermined Warren-Boulton's argument, that Microsoft seems headed toward obtaining a monopoly in Internet browser software to match the one it apparently holds in operating systems.
