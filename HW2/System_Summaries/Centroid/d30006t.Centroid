Not only are both sides still awaiting the outcome of an arbitration decision that is due before Oct. 18 the Fordham Law School dean John Feerick will rule whether or not more than 200 players with$ 800 million in guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout but the owners and players also are making time to win public opinion before they test their fans loyalties by canceling games.
