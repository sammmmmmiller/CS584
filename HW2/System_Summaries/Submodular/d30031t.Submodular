NASA has only five minutes or less each day to launch Endeavour in order to meet up with the first space station part, which was put in orbit two weeks ago by the Russians. 
But we do things right. 
The astronauts will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian space station piece and attach it to Unity. 
Endeavour and its astronauts closed in Sunday to capture the first piece of the international space station, the Russian-made Zarya control module that had to be connected to the Unity chamber aboard the shuttle. 
In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm, two spacewalking astronauts would have to manually fit them together.
