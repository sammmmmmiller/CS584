The fire broke out about midnight in building of the local Macedonian Association, which organized the dance. 
The building had just two exits, one of which was blocked by fire, city police technician Stephen Holmberg was quoted as saying by TT. 
The cause of the fire had not been determined as of Friday evening. 
No police. 
Only kids helping each other, he said from his bed in a Goteborg hospital. 
A panicky telephone call in poor Swedish was the first word that authorities got of a fire racing through a dance hall crowded with immigrant teen-agers, delaying fire squads' response to the blaze that killed 60 and injured 162, officials said Saturday. 
No police.
