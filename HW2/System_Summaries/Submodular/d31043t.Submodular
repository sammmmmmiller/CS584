Lahoud, appointed army commander in 1989 amid a rebellion in the fractured military during the 1975-90 civil war, is credited with rebuilding the 55,000-strong Lebanese army and in ending the reign of militias. 
Lahoud is to be sworn in for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaves office. 
Lahoud had been expected to issue a presidential decree last week asking Hariri to form the next government after the president polled members of the 128-seat Parliament on their choice for prime minister. 
In a statement, Lahoud said Hariri was asked but declined to form the next government after a previous round of consultations.
