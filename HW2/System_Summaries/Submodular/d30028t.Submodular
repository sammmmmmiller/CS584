Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met here Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and Turkey. 
Syria claims the ties are a threat to the Arab world, and on Saturday, Damascus again accused Turkey of plotting with Israel to undermine Syria. 
Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting fears of an attack. 
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus on Sunday that Turkey would not allow its neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels. 
Lebanon on Monday denied it is harboring Kurdish rebels and blamed Israel for the rising tension between Syria and Turkey. 
Syria has denied the charge.
