Liu was never put on trial. 
Over the past six months, dissidents in 14 provinces and cities have tried to use Chinese laws to set up and register the China Democracy Party. 
The arrests of Xu, Wang and Qin deprive the party of its more influential members, Zha said. 
Having been released from prison two years before, Xu was still not openly involved in dissident politics, but he held court in his Beijing home to discuss China's future. 
He said the harsh prison sentences given out Monday to the dissidents were to be expected, especially since Xu and Wang had been involved in trying to set up a political party to challenge the Communists.
