Citing stalled negotiations with the Players Association over a new collective bargaining agreement, league officials said they would decide next week whether to cancel the first week of regular season games. 
With training camp originally scheduled to open on Oct. 6, the message from the players is clear: if the owners would call an end to the lockout, we would be ready to play today. 
The decision to cancel 99 games between Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 came after the players association proposed the implementation of a tax system instead of a hard salary cap, a proposal the owners said they would respond to by Friday. 
And I think the league feels the same way.
