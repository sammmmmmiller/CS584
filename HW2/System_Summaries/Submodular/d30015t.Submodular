We hope to make clear to president Milosevic and the people of Yugoslavia the extreme gravity of the situation, Holbrooke said after a meeting with NATO leaders. 
Holbrooke issued no statement after the meeting. 
The American envoy Richard Holbrooke met with President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia Monday night and according to American diplomats told him that he had to take further steps to pull back his military in Kosovo Province or face a NATO attack. 
Milosevic was apparently accusing Holbrooke of supporting the ethnic Albanian guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who have been fighting to make the Serbian province of Kosovo an independent nation.
