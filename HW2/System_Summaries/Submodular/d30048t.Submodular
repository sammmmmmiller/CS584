U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration, aware of the impact that a Latin American recession would have on the United States, has actively pushed the IMF and the World Bank to support Brazil after it was hit by investor flight. 
Brazil and the International Monetary Fund moved closer Tuesday to agreement on an expected dlrs 30 billion rescue package for the world's ninth-largest economy. 
A joint statement by the IMF and the Brazilian government said the two sides agreed Brazil should aim to reduce its budget deficit from an expected eight percent of gross domestic product to zero by 2000. 
Cardoso himself has promised to travel less and more cheaply.
