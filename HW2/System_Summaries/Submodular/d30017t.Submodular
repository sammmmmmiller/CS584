A congressman who visited remote parts of North Korea last week said Saturday that the food and health situation there was desperate and deteriorating, and that millions of North Koreans might have starved to death in the last few years. 
This is accepted as normal! 
Although the North Koreans date their food problems to a series of floods and droughts in the mid-1990's, the foreign researchers who have worked in North Korea say medical records and childhood growth patterns indicate that the hunger began several years before that and is linked to the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had long been North Korea's main supplier of food, fuel and fertilizer.
