Russian President Boris Yeltsin cut short a trip to Central Asia on Monday due to a respiratory infection that revived questions about his overall health and ability to lead Russia through a sustained economic crisis. 
However, Yeltsin's condition was stable, Yakushkin said. 
The prime minister reiterated Wednesday that Yeltsin has no plans to resign or call early elections. 
Doctors ordered the president to stay in bed Tuesday and his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, had said Yeltsin would not be in the office all week. 
The president and his doctors say Yeltsin has no serious health problems and will serve out the final two years of his term.
