Republicans agreed. 
Both conservatives and moderates in the party said the Republicans had to get back to basics. 
But Gingrich also seemed aware of the mounting concern about his leadership, repeatedly casting the election results as a victory for his leadership team because Republicans had stayed in the majority for three elections in a row for the first time in 70 years. 
Because the Republicans now control the House by only 12 seats, it would take just six votes against Gingrich to deny him a majority and allow Democrats to potentially elect one of their own as speaker. 
Many Republicans immediately blamed Gingrich for the party's losses on Tuesday.
