Executives representing Netscape, AOL and Sun Microsystems are government witnesses at the Microsoft trial. 
One of the government's allegations in the antitrust suit is that Microsoft won out over Netscape as the main browser for AOL because Microsoft used its Windows monopoly as a bargaining chip. 
IBM rose 7, to 166 5/8. 
Even before the Netscape deal, America Online was moving to provide some electronic commerce software and services. 
This new software, which now will be combined with Netscape's online store services, will be available for companies to use both on America Online and on the Internet. 
America Online is to stores on the broader Internet.
