He said the party would announce its decision Thursday. 
Ecevit was expected to meet with Yilmaz on Thursday, and other party leaders Friday. 
Refusing any alliance with the pro-Islamic Virtue Party, Turkey's largest party in Parliament, Ecevit was unable to create a political alliance strong enough to survive a confidence vote in the deeply divided legislature. 
He got support from center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz, who said his party supported Erez as long as he had Ecevit's backing. 
Turkey has been trying to form a new government since a coalition government led by Yilmaz collapsed last month over allegations that he rigged the sale of a bank.
