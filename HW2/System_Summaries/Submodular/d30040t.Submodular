As part of the latest Mideast peace accord, Israeli and Palestinian officials were to sign a protocol for the airport Friday and Palestinian negotiators said Gaza International Airport would open Sunday. 
Officials said Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may travel by car to Egypt in order to fly into the airport. 
Israel retains security control over flights arriving to Gaza International Airport. 
Earlier this week, Israel threatened to close down the Gaza airport when Palestinian airport workers refused to allow Israeli security officials to check the identity of passengers who arrived on an Egyptian plane, most of whom worked for the Palestinian Authority.
