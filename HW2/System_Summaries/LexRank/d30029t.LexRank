Two sailors died and 15 others were missing after gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in the Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race Monday.
A police helicopter rescued a yachtsman swept overboard when the Victorian yacht Kingurra was rolled over in huge seas 19 nautical miles south of Gabo Island.
One of the missing yachts B-52 was found mid-morning Monday and was making its way towards Eden on the New South Wales coast, an AusSAR spokesman said.
Three yachts remain missing and there was no sign of a sailor swept off the Sword of Orion when the boat rolled in wild seas on Sunday night.
It does say in the instructions that it is the sole responsibility of the skipper of each yacht to decide whether he continues in the race or retires, he said.
