This new software, which now will be combined with Netscape's online store services, will be available for companies to use both on America Online and on the Internet.
Even before the Netscape deal, America Online was moving to provide some electronic commerce software and services.
For the present, however, the idea is to make America Online, the nation's leading online service, the standard way to get onto the Internet, the executives explained.
America Online has really changed from a closed online service for novice users to an Internet media and technology company with a diverse set of brands, Andreessen said.
But America Online now says it has ambitions to offer a much wider array of software, consulting and services for online merchants.
