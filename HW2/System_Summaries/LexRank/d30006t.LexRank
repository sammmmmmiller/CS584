If we win, I think it just emboldens the spirit and resolve of the players, union director Billy Hunter said.
The idea is that if the players had no union, it would be illegal under antitrust laws for the owners to collude.
The decision to cancel 99 games between Nov. 3 and Nov. 16 came after the players association proposed the implementation of a tax system instead of a hard salary cap, a proposal the owners said they would respond to by Friday.
A ruling for the union would be significant for all future negotiations between players and owners.
After the players saw these proposals from the league and the recent posturing by NBA owners, well, I had two players call me up and tell me, if need be, they'd be willing to hock everything they've got.
