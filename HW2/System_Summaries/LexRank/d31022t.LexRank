The fact that it spread so fast indicates that it was not a normal fire, he said.
Fire officials were alerted at 11 : 43 p.m.( 2243 GMT) Thursday and had a fire truck at the scene four minutes later, rescue workers said.
Olin said there were signs that the fire was set.
The fire was the deadliest in modern Swedish history since 1978, when 20 people died in the town of Boraas.
Jamal Fawz, 15, told TT that he was out on the dance floor when the blaze started with about 400 people inside.
I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped.
A fire turned a Swedish dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing at least 60 people and injuring about 180.
