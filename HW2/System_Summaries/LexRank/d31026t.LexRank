After the Padres beat the Braves, 3-0, in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series on Thursday night in Atlanta to take a two-game lead in the four-of-seven-game series, San Diego fans began gearing up for a shot at the World Series in more traditional ways.
Brown, seen by many as San Diego's best hope for a World Series upset, will not pitch again until Game 4, at the earliest.
He is 5 for 30 with 10 strikeouts, no homers and only 1 run batted in for a hitting-starved team that has batted .229 while still winning 7 of 9 post-season games because of superior pitching.
Orlando Hernandez will pitch against Andy Ashby in Game 2 Sunday night at the Stadium.
