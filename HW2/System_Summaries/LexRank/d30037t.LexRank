Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel Sharon, a hawkish former defense minister, to be Israeli foreign minister on Friday in an effort to placate the far right as he moves closer to turning over more West Bank land to the Palestinians.
Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli foreign minister serves as the bullet of mercy for the Middle East peace process, an official Syrian newspaper said Saturday.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians.
Both his friends and foes would agree that the new foreign minister is not a natural diplomat.
The newspaper said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is close to making a decision on the appointment.
