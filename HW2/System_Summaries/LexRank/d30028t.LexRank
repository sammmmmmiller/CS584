We have no part in this tension, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday.
Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz denied Monday that Kurdish rebels were based in his country.
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said his country backs Syria in the dispute, which was triggered Sunday when Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus that his country would not allow its neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels.
The agency also quoted Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa as saying that Egypt and Syria agreed on the graveness of the situation and that it should be dealt with diplomatically and not through confrontation or threats.
But Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who accompanied him on the trip, said before their departure that Mubarak backs dialogue for solving disputes and not military power and threats.
