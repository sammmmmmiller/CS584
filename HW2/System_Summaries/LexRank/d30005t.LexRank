Bin Laden, a Saudi exile, is thought to be living in Afghanistan.
Federal authorities said that Khalid al Fawwaz, a London-based associate of bin Laden, directed Fazil to report periodically to bin Laden about the security situation of the cell.
Without any evidence, bin Laden is a man without sin.
One of the clear but unstated objectives of last August's raid on Afghanistan was to kill Osama bin Laden and as many of his lieutenants as possible, administration officials now acknowledge.
Fawwaz, who served as an informal press spokesman for bin Laden in London, was arrested by British authorities in September after the embassy bombings.
The Taliban have refused to turn over bin Laden to the United States, but they say if there is evidence they will try him under Islamic law.
