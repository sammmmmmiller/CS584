Hun Sen said his current government would remain in power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one.
Negotiations to form the next government have become deadlocked, and opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy are out of the country following threats of arrest from strongman Hun Sen. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying to make its members return an international issue.
The assurances were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. offices in September to avoid arrest after Hun Sen accused him of being behind a plot against his life.
Hun Sen said on Friday that the opposition concerns over their safety in the country was just an excuse for them to stay abroad.
