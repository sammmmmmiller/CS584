The astronauts will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian space station piece and attach it to Unity.
For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight.
The planet's most daring construction job began Friday as the shuttle Endeavour carried into orbit six astronauts and the first U.S.-built part of an international space station that is expected to cost more than$ 100 billion.
In case Zarya and Unity could not be connected with the robot arm, two spacewalking astronauts would have to manually fit them together.
The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw up their hands.
Great show, Endeavour, mission control in Houston radioed to the six astronauts as the shuttle went into orbit.
