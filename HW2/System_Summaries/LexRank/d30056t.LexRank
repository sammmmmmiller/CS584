His release came four days after the severed heads of four foreign hostages were found in Chechnya when a government rescue attempt apparently went wrong.
The hostages Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and New Zealand's Stanley Shaw were engineers.
The severed heads of the hostages three Britons and a New Zealander were found Tuesday.
The suspect was identified as Apti Abitayev, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
Chechen police were searching Wednesday for the bodies of four kidnapped foreigners who were beheaded during a botched attempt to free them.
The heads were identified as those of the four abducted foreigners by Umar Makhauri, who had been a bodyguard assigned to the four when they were abducted Oct. 3 by unidentified gunmen in Grozny.
