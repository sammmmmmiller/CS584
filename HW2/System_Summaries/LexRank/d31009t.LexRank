Deniz Baykal, leader of the center-left Republican party whose backing in parliament helps Yilmaz's minority government, said he would withdraw his support unless the premier resigned immediately.
Ecevut's alternate efforts to make a minority coalition with outside backing for his Democratic Left Party from Parliament also failed.
Turkey's secular parties are under pressure to join forces to keep the Islamic Virtue Party out of power.
He got support from center-right leader Mesut Yilmaz, who said his party supported Erez as long as he had Ecevit's backing.
It is now clear that no party leader can form a government that can win a vote of confidence, former Premier Mesut Yilmaz said after talks with Demirel.
They fear it will produce a Parliament just as divided as the present one, perhaps with the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party as the largest bloc.
