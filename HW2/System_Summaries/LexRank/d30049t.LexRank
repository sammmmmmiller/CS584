The United States and North Korea are set to resume talks Friday about inspections of an underground North Korean site suspected of being used to produce nuclear weapons.
The North Koreans have denied that the complex, which is being built on a mountainside about 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, the former North Korean nuclear research center, is intended to be used for a nuclear weapons program.
He called for full access for U.S. inspectors at a North Korean underground facility and said the North must not develop missiles.
The United States rejected the request during meetings this week in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, between North Korean officials and a U.S. government delegation.
U.S. intelligence agencies fear that by building the complex, North Korea may have decided to abandon a four-year-old agreement with the United States in which North Korea pledged to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid.
