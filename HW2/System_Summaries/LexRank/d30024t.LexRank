Trying to put the best face on the results, Speaker Newt Gingrich said in Marietta, Ga., that the Republicans still held onto the House for three elections in a row for the first time since the election of 1932.
A week after the White House and congressional Democrats disavowed his war on Speaker Newt Gingrich, James Carville, President Clinton's former campaign strategist and chief outside defender, put forth a new battle cry Wednesday : He will not be muzzled.
The speaker was right to say this was not the election we expected.
Because the Republicans now control the House by only 12 seats, it would take just six votes against Gingrich to deny him a majority and allow Democrats to potentially elect one of their own as speaker.
