They also said Italian authorities were warned that Ocalan would be arriving.
Italian authorities captured Abdullah Ocalan at Rome's international airport Thursday.
Better known as Apo, Ocalan founded the Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, in 1978.
Turkey stepped up pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, saying Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to opening doors to terrorism.
Ocalan seemed to be moving in this direction before his detention.
About 1,500 Kurds who spent the night outside a military hospital where Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is believed held continued their hunger strike Monday to protest his detention.
