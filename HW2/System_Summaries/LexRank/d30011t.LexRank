Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime minister and finance minister, saying he was morally unfit for office.
After first suggesting that the former deputy prime minister had beaten himself on the face, neck and arms during 10 days in police custody, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called for an investigation of the wounds Anwar displayed in court Tuesday and Wednesday.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday he is not too choosy about who will be his successor.
But the prime minister said the deputy was fired because he was morally unfit.
Anwar, says the prime minister, is despicable and a sodomist.
Mahathir told reporters later that Anwar had been working toward toppling him as prime minister and president of the governing coalition's dominant party, the United Malays National Organization.
