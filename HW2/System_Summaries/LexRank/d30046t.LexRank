House Speaker-elect Robert L. Livingston presented a fresh note of shock to the impeachment debate against President Clinton on Thursday night as the Republican leader was forced to admit to his Republican colleagues that he had carried on adulterous affairs in his past.
His spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said, The president has no intention of resigning.
The months leading up to the impeachment of President Clinton had become a series of televised anticlimaxes, but the hours before the vote made up for that lack of drama.
The president is charged in an impeachment resolution with perjury and abuse of power in his attempt to hide sexual indiscretions.
I must set the example that I hope President Clinton will follow, Livingston declared, flabbergasting all attending the impeachment debate and the nation watching beyond.
