Indonesian President B. J. Habibie finds attending a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders "difficult" because of his concerns about the arrest of Malaysia's former deputy prime minister.
On Sept. 2, Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar, calling him morally unfit for office.
The two had differed over economic policy and Anwar has said Mahathir feared he was a threat to his 17-year rule.
Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 under the Internal Security Act, which allows jail without trial.
Anwar since has been charged with corruption and illegal homosexual acts, and is to go on trial Nov. 2.
