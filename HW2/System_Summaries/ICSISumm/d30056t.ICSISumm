A French United Nations official kidnapped in southern Russia more than 10 months ago has been freed and was flown to Moscow Saturday.
His release came four days after the severed heads of four foreign hostages were found in Chechnya when a government rescue attempt apparently went wrong.
Tagirov was investigating the deaths Britons Peter Kennedy, Darren Hickey, and Rudolf Petschi, and Stanley Shaw of New Zealand.
They had been abducted by unidentified gunmen Oct. 3 in Grozny.
Chechen police were searching Wednesday for the bodies of four kidnapped foreigners who were beheaded during a botched attempt to free them.
