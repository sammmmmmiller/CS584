After meeting Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in a desert tent, U. N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he thinks an arrangement for bringing two suspects to trial in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner could be secured in the "not too distant future."
Libya has been under U. N. sanctions since 1992 for its refusal to hand over the two alleged intelligence agents, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah.
U. N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan arrived in Libya Saturday for talks aimed at bringing to trial two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
