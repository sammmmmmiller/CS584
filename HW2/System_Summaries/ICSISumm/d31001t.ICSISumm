Facing a court challenge, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission said Wednesday that it would withhold, at least temporarily, the parts of its final report that implicate South Africa's last apartheid-era president, F. W. de Klerk, in illegal acts.
De Klerk has not applied for amnesty in this matter or any other.
It was excised because de Klerk is suing the commission.
A panel probing apartheid-era abuses has accused the African National Congress of human rights violations, including torture and bomb attacks.
Criminal prosecutions for atrocities committed during the war against white rule could drag on for at least six years.
