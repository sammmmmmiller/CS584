Cambodian leader Hun Sen rejected opposition parties' demands for talks outside the country, accusing them of trying to "internationalize" the political crisis.
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats in July's elections, short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a government on its own.
Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence.
The agreement will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly.
