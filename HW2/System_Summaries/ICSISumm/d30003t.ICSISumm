Europe's top official said Friday that he hoped former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet would be extradited to Spain to be tried for crimes committed during his 17-year rule.
Pinochet was detained in the London clinic while recovering from back surgery.
Pinochet, 82, was placed under arrest in London Friday by British police acting on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge.
He was arrested Oct. 16 at the instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite him on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture.
Spain was the biggest single investor in Chile last year, followed closely by Britain.
