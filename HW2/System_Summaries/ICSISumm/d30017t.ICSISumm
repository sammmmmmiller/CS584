Years of food shortages have stunted the growth of millions of North Korean children, with two-thirds of children under age seven suffering malnourishment, U. N. experts said Wednesday.
North Korea is entering its fourth winter of chronic food shortages, having harvested only 3 million tons of grain this year, about two-thirds of the minimum needed by its 23 million people.
All complained about severe food and fuel shortages in their country.
Hunger and malnutrition in Cambodia are reaching crisis levels comparable to the effects of famine in North Korea, a U. N. World Food Program representative said Tuesday.
