Taking a major step toward statehood, the Palestinians inaugurated Gaza International Airport, their first gateway to the world, with cheers, tears and an outpouring of patriotism.
The airport's opening last month, stipulated by the accords brokered by U. S. President Bill Clinton at Wye River, Maryland in October, was hailed by Palestinians as a milestone toward independence and statehood.
Israel has threatened to close down the Palestinian-run Gaza airport over a security violation, an Israeli official said Tuesday, a move that could further undermine the already fragile peace process.
Israel retains security control over flights arriving to Gaza International Airport.
