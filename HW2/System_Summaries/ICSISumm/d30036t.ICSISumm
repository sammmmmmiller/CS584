Robert F. Furchgott, Louis J. Ignarro and Ferid Murad of the United States won the Nobel Medicine Prize.
The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the industrialist and inventor of dynamite whose will established the prizes.
In its citation Thursday, the Swedish Academy praised Saramago "who with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory reality."
Jose Saramago became the first writer in Portuguese to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.
Since the 1980s, his works have been translated into more than 20 languages.
