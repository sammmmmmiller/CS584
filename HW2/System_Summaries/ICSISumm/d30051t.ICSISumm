The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal Monday acquitted a Muslim military commander of war crimes against Bosnian Serb prisoners in 1992, but convicted three underlings in the first U. N. case dealing with anti-Serb atrocities.
The tribunal, set up by the Security Council in 1993, has convicted only one other person following a trial, Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, who was sentenced in May 1997 to 20 years for killing and torturing Muslims in 1992.
During the trial, the tribunal's longest to date involving 122 witnesses, survivors described the campaign of terror unleashed against Serbs in the area.
