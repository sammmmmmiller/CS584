Russia's new prime minister picked an unusual way to reassure the nation Thursday.
President Boris Yeltsin would respond strongly to any effort to prohibit Russians from buying foreign currencies, believing the move would be like bringing another Iron Curtain down on the country.
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that the economic crisis would not bring an end to the government's program of privatizing state property.
If the Communist Party has its way, and it has been planning for months, millions of Russians will take to the streets for some of the biggest demonstrations in years.
