Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay.
The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before handled an object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakstan on Nov. 20.
The station will serve as an orbital home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for at least 15 years.
Zarya is to fly alone for two weeks before a rendezvous with the American space shuttle Endeavor, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the Unity connecting module.
