Russia's Constitutional Court opened hearings Thursday on whether Boris Yeltsin can seek a third term.
The president insists he has no major health problems and will serve out the remaining two years of his term.
A respiratory infection forced him to cut short a trip to Central Asia earlier this week.
Yeltsin has a history of health problems, and underwent heart bypass surgery in 1996.
Doctors ordered Russian President Boris Yeltsin to cut short his Central Asian trip because of a respiratory infection and he agreed to return home Monday, a day earlier than planned.
