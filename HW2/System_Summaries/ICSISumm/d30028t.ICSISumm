Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met here Sunday with Syrian President Hafez Assad to try to defuse growing tension between Syria and Turkey.
"We have no part in this tension," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters in Jerusalem.
For its part, Syria has accused Turkey of forming military alliances with Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
Ankara has sent troops to its border with Syria, prompting fears of an attack.
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel warned Damascus that Turkey would not allow its neighbor to continue sheltering Kurdish rebels.
