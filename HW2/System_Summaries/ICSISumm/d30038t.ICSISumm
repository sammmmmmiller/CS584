A top IOC official made explosive allegations of widespread Olympic corruption, saying agents demand up to dlrs 1 million to deliver votes in the selection of host cities.
IOC executive board member Marc Hodler said the scholarship fund, described as "humanitarian aid" by Salt Lake officials, amounted to a "bribe."
The International Olympic Committee has ordered a top-level investigation into the payment of nearly dlrs 400,000 in scholarships to relatives of IOC members by the Salt Lake group which won the bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch immediately disassociated himself from Hodler's allegations.
