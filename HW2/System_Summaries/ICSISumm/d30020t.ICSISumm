Saudi Arabia is considering sending a small team to the Bangkok Asian Games from which it pulled out unexpectedly this week.
Saudi sports authorities said the Games conflicted with national centenary celebrations and the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
The plea to reconsider was made by Sheik Ahmad al-Fahd al Sabah, president of the Olympic Council of Asia.
The Asian Games will be held from the Dec. 6-20.
Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, who chairs the organizing committee, expressed doubt last month that the complex would be completed on time because of the financial problems.
