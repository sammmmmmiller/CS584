The case of United States vs. Microsoft Corp., the government's most aggressive move against a monopolist in almost 25 years, is playing out against a century of antitrust laws so broadly worded and court rulings so ambiguous that both sides are citing the same rulings to support their opposing arguments.
The case focuses on Microsoft's Windows, the operating system that controls about 90 percent of all personal computers sold today.
The latter threat is key, according to the Justice Department.
Leading the challenge was Netscape Communications Corp., whose software for browsing the World Wide Web had ignited the Internet boom.
