Parliament formally elected Gen. Emile Lahoud, the popular army commander who has the backing of powerful neighbor Syria, as Lebanon's next president.
Lahoud is to be sworn in for a six-year term on Nov. 24, the day President Elias Hrawi leaves office.
Hariri is credited with restoring economic confidence and stabilizing the national currency.
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri has declined an informal invitation from Lebanon's new president to form the next government, sparking a political crisis in this country as it rebuilds from its devastating civil war.
Lahoud pledged in a tough inauguration speech to clean up the graft-riddled administration.
