A liberal lawmaker who planned to run for president in Russia's next elections was shot to death Friday in St. Petersburg.
She served as President Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues and was on the human rights committee of the USSR's Supreme Soviet.
A finance official was attacked earlier this week, a top banker was killed last week, and an aide to Russia's parliament speaker was shot in the head last month.
Galina Starovoitova, a member of the lower house of Russia's parliament from the reformist party Democratic Russia, was attacked in an apartment building along with her aide.
