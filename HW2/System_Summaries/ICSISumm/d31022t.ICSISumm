A fire turned a dance hall jammed with teen-age Halloween revelers into a deathtrap, killing 60 people and injuring 162 others in Sweden's second-largest city.
The dance was attended mostly by immigrants or children of immigrants.
"Lots of kids were just screaming," he added at Hammarkullen Lutheran Church, where several dozen family and friends of victims gathered.
The fire, at the facilities of the Macedonian Association local immigrant group, was the deadliest in modern Swedish history.
Police said most victims choked to death on smoke and poisonous gases; 59 bodies were found at the scene and six others died later.
