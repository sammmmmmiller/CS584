Bob Livingston, the incoming speaker of the House, took no public role Friday as the debate unfolded on whether to impeach President Clinton.
The Republicans will pay a huge price for their brazen, utterly partisan attempt to drag a president from the White House in defiance of the will of the people.
Impeach! Impeach! And that continued even after the stunning announcement Saturday morning that Livingston would quit the House.
The impeachment, said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, was "a debate about relativism vs. absolute truth."
"We're losing track of distinction between sins and crimes," said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N. Y.
