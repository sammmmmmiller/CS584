Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station, creating a seven-story tower in the shuttle cargo bay.
"We have capture of Zarya," commander Robert Cabana announced the two pieces came together.
Mission Control ordered the pilots to fire the shuttle thrusters to put an extra three miles between Endeavour and the space junk, putting Endeavour a total of five miles from the orbiting debris.
The shuttle's 50-foot robot arm had never before handled an object as massive as the 41-foot, 44,000-pound Zarya, a power and propulsion module that was launched from Kazakstan on Nov. 20.
