A Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast faces an uncertain future following the detention in Rome of its founder and leader.
Turkey stepped up pressure on Italy for the extradition of captured Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, saying Sunday that granting him asylum would amount to "opening doors to terrorism."
Thousands of Kurds living in Romania closed down restaurants, shops and companies to protest the arrest of leader Abdullah Ocalan by Italian authorities.
Turkey has asked for Ocalan to be returned to Turkey.
Better known as Apo, Ocalan founded the Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, in 1978.
