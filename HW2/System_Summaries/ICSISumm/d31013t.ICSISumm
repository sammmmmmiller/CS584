James Kopp, the man the FBI is seeking as a material witness in the sniper slaying of Dr. Barnett Slepian, is known to abortion rights leaders as an aggressive anti-abortion protester, and law enforcement officials say he has been arrested several times in demonstrations at abortion clinics.
An American anti-abortion activist, James Kopp, is wanted for questioning about the shootings.
The authorities also say he may have information that will help solve four other sniper attacks on doctors who performed abortions in Canada and upstate New York.
He was an early follower of Randall Terry, a leader of Operation Rescue.
