Gale-force winds and high seas battered yachts in Australia's Sydney-to-Hobart race Monday, killing at least two crew members and leaving three yachts missing.
Despite the horrendous conditions it was unlikely the race would be called off.
The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway across Bass Strait when it overturned.
The American maxi Sayonara was narrowly ahead of last year's winner, Brindabella.
John Campbell, an American, was in the water for about 40 minutes and was suffering from hypothermia when he was winched to safety by senior constable Barry Barclay, who dropped into large swells to secure Campbell.
